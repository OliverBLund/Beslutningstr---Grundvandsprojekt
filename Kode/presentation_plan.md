  - Normal thresholds vs Landfill-specific thresholds
  - Representative compounds for each category
  - Override status (stricter/looser/none)

**Slide 11: Landfill Override Results**
- 705 combinations reclassified to LOSSEPLADS categories
- 367 combinations removed (failed stricter thresholds)
- Visual: **NEW** - Before/after category distribution chart

**Slide 12: Landfill Override Impact by Category**
- Breakdown by compound category:
  - UORGANISKE_FORBINDELSER: 299 overrides (50m threshold)
  - BTXER: 191 overrides (70m threshold)
  - PESTICIDER: 114 overrides (180m MCPP threshold)
  - KLOREREDE_OPLÃ˜SNINGSMIDLER: 63 overrides (100m threshold)
  - PHENOLER: 38 overrides (35m threshold)
- Visual: **NEW** - Horizontal bar chart showing override counts

### **5. Final Results & Impact (3-4 slides)**

**Slide 13: Overall Results Summary**
- General Assessment: 4,156 high-risk sites (500m threshold)
- Compound-Specific: 2,013 high-risk sites (4,235 combinations)
- Geographic impact: 232 affected GVFK (11.4% of all Danish GVFK)
- Visual: **NEW** - Summary infographic with key numbers

**Slide 14: Geographic Distribution**
- **NEW**: Map showing:
  - All GVFK in gray
  - River-contact GVFK in blue
  - High-risk GVFK in red/orange
  - Different intensities for number of high-risk sites

**Slide 15: Category Distribution Analysis**
- Final compound category breakdown with counts
- Multi-substance site statistics
- Visual: Pie chart + stacked bar showing category distribution

### **6. Research Validation & Quality Assurance (2-3 slides)**

**Slide 16: Method Validation**
- Comprehensive testing of landfill override logic
- Verification of threshold compliance (0 violations found)
- Multi-substance site handling validation
- Edge case testing completed

**Slide 17: Additional Research Insights**
- Compound categorization refinement (425 substances mapped)
- LOSSEPLADS category optimization (180mâ†’100m, perkolat focus)
- Missing combinations analysis (367 correctly removed)

### **7. Conclusion & Next Steps (1-2 slides)**

**Slide 18: Project Impact & Future Work**
- Systematic risk identification: 2,013 priority sites identified
- Reduction: From 35,728 total sites â†’ 2,013 high-priority (94% reduction)
- Next phase: Quantitative state assessment with GEUS
